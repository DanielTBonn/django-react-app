# Django React App

## Description
  
To keep my backend skills fresh and update my understanding of Python I decided to build a quick project to connect a Django backend to a React front end. In doing so I am learning a new framework, adding to my dev portfolio with Python, and reinforcing my understanding of Full Stack Development.

## Installation
  
From the command line, `git clone` this repo and then download a venv as well as the requirements using `pip`.

## Usage
  
This project is still a work in progress, but I would like to add a frontend using a technology that can quickly scaffold the design of the website (Tailwinds, Bootstrap, etc).

## Tests
  
Start up your virtual environment by running `. venv/Script/activate` from the top level app directory at the command line, then run `py manage.py test` to run any tests.
